# ðŸš€ Welcome to GovConnex UI!

### [**GitHub**](https://github.com/GovConnex/UI) | [**npm**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@govconnex/ui)

This storybook documents the design system and components of GovConnex UI.

## Usage
### Install as a dependency
```bash
yarn add @govconnex/ui
```
### Import a component
```javascript
import { Button } from '@govconnex/ui';

// <Button>Click me</Button>
```

## Figma Tokens Plugin
The [Figma Tokens Plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/843461159747178978/Figma-Tokens) is used by designers and developers, as it is needed for modifying, and inspecting tokens in Figma.

### Setup (developers)
In Figma Tokens, navigate to Sync => URL => Add new credentials.

Set URL to ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GovConnex/UI/main/src/theming/tokens-figma/tokens.json```

This is easier than syncing with GitHub, but is read-only, thus only suitable for developers.

### Setup (designers)

In Figma Tokens, navigate to Sync => GitHub => Add new credentials.

Get a Personal Access Token from [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/tokens) (give the token ```repo``` access).

Set File Path to ```src/theming/tokens-figma/tokens.json```

## Design System Changes

When adding, removing, or renaming a design token, update the theme interfaces to reflect your changes.

```src/theming/global-theme.interface.ts``` for **global** theme changes.

```src/theming/theme.interface.d.ts``` for **light/dark** theme changes.

This provides type safety and helps with code completion.

If the theme interfaces don't match the Figma tokens structure, the CI/CD pipeline will fail,
so make sure you're subscribed to notifications for GitHub Actions.

Design system changes will automatically be added to the Storybook documentation.
