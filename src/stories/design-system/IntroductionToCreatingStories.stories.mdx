# Creating stories of your own

## We have a standardized way now of creating stories! It is encouraged that we follow proper documentation and be as informative as we can when creating our stories. 

1. #### Create a component named ```YourCompentName.stories.tsx``` under you component folder.

2. #### Add the necessary imports for your story
```jsx
// Some necessary imports
import React from "react";
import {ComponentStory, ComponentMeta} from "@storybook/react";
import {withDesign} from "storybook-addon-designs";
// Your component
import BackgroundIcon from "./BackgroundIcon";
// Other imports. In this case, we need to import the icons
import {faSearch, faStar} from "@fortawesome/pro-solid-svg-icons";
import {faStar as faStarLight} from "@fortawesome/pro-light-svg-icons";
```

3. #### Add a component meta. This will include a ```title, component, and decorators```. Here is an example:
More on default export: https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/introduction#default-export
```jsx
export default {
  title: "Components/BackgroundIcon",
  component: BackgroundIcon,
  decorators: [withDesign],
} as ComponentMeta<typeof BackgroundIcon>;
```

4. #### In your story file, before the component meta, create a summary of the component as a short description, some context as to why the component was created, as well as its figma link
```jsx
const summary = "##Summary\nThe Background icon component may contain various icons to visualize or to give information as an image.\n\n";
const context = "##Context\nThe Background component was added to create a visual of the information it is trying to portray.\n\n";
const figmaLink = "##Figma Link\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/yJ8kQwyMxuTZudD90MxgOU/%F0%9F%93%90-Components-and-Patterns?type=design&node-id=103-320&mode=design&t=QFaUGXlsf04huhew-0";
const markdown = summary + context + figmaLink;
```
In the story's component meta, we should put the markdown variable in the description like so:
```jsx
export default {
  title: "Components/BackgroundIcon",
  component: BackgroundIcon,
  decorators: [withDesign],
  parameters: {
    docs: {
      description: {
        component: markdown, 
      },
    },
  },
} as ComponentMeta<typeof BackgroundIcon>;
```

5. #### For better documentation, we should put the ```argTypes``` which include properties and their attributes in the component meta as well. Ideally, for each property, it would have a ```description, type, control, and defaultValue```. 
  - ```description``` is a short message on what the property is about. 
  - ```type``` is the property's data type. 
  - ```control``` is the type of control it will show as in the storybook documentation. 
  - ```defaultValue``` is the value which will be intially loaded in the docs. 

Below is an example of it:
```jsx
export default {
  title: "Components/BackgroundIcon",
  component: BackgroundIcon,
  decorators: [withDesign],
  argTypes: {
    icon: {
      description: "Icon of the component from fortawesome",
    },
    size: {
      description: "Size of the component",
      type: "string",
      control: {
        type: "select",
        options: [
          "xs",
          "sm",
          "lg",
          "xl",
        ],
      },
      defaultValue: "sm",
    },
    cs: {
      description:
        "Custom styles of the component. Styles are similar to css styles but in camel case",
      type: Object,
    },
  },
  parameters: {
    docs: {
      description: {
        component: markdown,
      },
    },
  },
} as ComponentMeta<typeof BackgroundIcon>;
``` 

6. #### Next, add a template to be used for your stories:
More on component templates: https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/introduction#using-args
```jsx
const Template: ComponentStory<typeof BackgroundIcon> = (args: any) => (
  <BackgroundIcon {...args} />
);
```

7. #### Then, bind the template and create your first story
More on args: https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/args
```jsx
export const StarXs = Template.bind({});
StarXs.args = {
  icon: faStar,
  size: "xs",
};
```

8. #### Create other stories as you see fit!

### Your story should look something like this:
```jsx
import React from "react";
import {ComponentStory, ComponentMeta} from "@storybook/react";
import BackgroundIcon from "./BackgroundIcon";
import {withDesign} from "storybook-addon-designs";
import {faSearch, faStar} from "@fortawesome/pro-solid-svg-icons";

const summary =
  "##Summary\nThe Background icon component may contain various icons to visualize or to give information as an image.\n\n";
const context =
  "##Context\nThe Background component was added to create a visual of the information it is trying to portray.\n\n";
const figmaLink =
  "##Figma Link\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/yJ8kQwyMxuTZudD90MxgOU/%F0%9F%93%90-Components-and-Patterns?type=design&node-id=103-320&mode=design&t=QFaUGXlsf04huhew-0";
const markdown = summary + context + figmaLink;

export default {
  title: "Components/BackgroundIcon",
  component: BackgroundIcon,
  decorators: [withDesign],
  argTypes: {
    icon: {
      description: "Icon of the component from fortawesome",
    },
    size: {
      description: "Size of the component",
      type: "string",
      control: {
        type: "select",
        options: [
          "xs",
          "sm",
          "lg",
          "xl",
        ],
      },
      defaultValue: "sm",
    },
    cs: {
      description:
        "Custom styles of the component. Styles are similar to css styles but in camel case",
      type: Object,
    },
  },
  parameters: {
    docs: {
      description: {
        component: markdown,
      },
    },
  },
} as ComponentMeta<typeof BackgroundIcon>;

const Template: ComponentStory<typeof BackgroundIcon> = (args: any) => (
  <BackgroundIcon {...args} />
);
