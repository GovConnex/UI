# Creating stories of your own

## We have a standardized way now of creating stories! It is encouraged that we follow proper documentation and be as informative as we can when creating our stories. 

1. #### Create a summary of the component as a short description, some context as to why the component was created, as well as its figma link
```jsx
const summary = "##Summary\\nThe Background icon component may contain various icons to visualize or to give information as an image.\\n\\n";
const context = "##Context\\nThe Background component was added to create a visual of the information it is trying to portray.\\n\\n";
const figmaLink = "###Figma Link\\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/yJ8kQwyMxuTZudD90MxgOU/%F0%9F%93%90-Components-and-Patterns?type=design&node-id=103-320&mode=design&t=QFaUGXlsf04huhew-0";
const markdown = summary + context + figmaLink;
```
In the components component meta, we should put the markdown variable in the description like so:
```jsx
export default {
  title: "Components/BackgroundIcon",
  component: BackgroundIcon,
  decorators: [withDesign],
  parameters: {
    docs: {
      description: {
        component: markdown, 
      },
    },
  },
} as ComponentMeta<typeof BackgroundIcon>;
```
