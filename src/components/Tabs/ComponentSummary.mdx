## FAQs

### Whats the difference between Page Tabs and Section Tabs?

Page tabs serve to modify the complete page view. For example, while viewing a representative's profile, switching from their biography to their electorate changes the entire page. Conversely, section tabs enable view changes solely within specific sections, without affecting other page areas. An instance would be toggling between recent activities and pinned alerts in the Dashboard.
