## Best Practices

- Use the established variants and color patterns to enable users to easily distinguish the level of importance.
- Make sure to use the appropriate color variants based on the context, such as opting for the red variant for labels that signify danger or challenge.

- Use colors outside of the established variants solely when employing chips for labeling political parties.

- Refrain from using colors that are contextually inappropriate, such as using red to indicate success or positive labels.

Chip labels should contain one to two words to convey their message. Utilise more than two words only when required to describe a complex state.

- Connected

- Email Integration Connected

Always express the status in the past tense.

When using chips in text-heavy or content-rich areas, employ abbreviations or acronyms to reduce label length.
