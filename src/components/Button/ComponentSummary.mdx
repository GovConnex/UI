Buttons are used for facilitating interface actions. The primary style should be used specifically for the primary call-to-action. On the other hand, the remaining styles can be used more frequently throughout.
<br/>

## Best Practices

### âœ…Â Do

- Only use one primary button per section, as a main call-to-action.
- Use clear and accurate labels.
- Apply established button colors in a fitting manner. For instance, the ```danger``` button style solely for actions that involve challenges or irreversible consequences.
- Prioritize the most important actions. Too many buttons can cause confusion and make users unsure of what to do next.
- Maintain consistency in the placement of buttons within the user interface.
- Use strong, actionable verbs for labels such as ```Add```, ```Save```, or ```Cancel```.

### ðŸš«Â Donâ€™t

- Avoid using multiple primary buttons within a single section.
- Avoid utilizing buttons for navigation when the link is embedded within a sentence or follows it.
- Avoid using ambiguous labels that lack specific actions, such as ```Click here``` or ```More```.

## Content Guidelines

Buttons must lead with a strong verb that motivates action. To ensure users have adequate context, utilize the [verb] + [noun] content structure for buttons, except for common actions such as ```Done```,```Close```,```Cancel```, or ```OK```.

### âœ…Â Do

- View notification settings
- See all topics

### ðŸš«Â Donâ€™t

- Notification settings
- All topics

While writing button labels, consistently utilize sentence case, as opposed to title case. Capitalize the first word and leave the subsequent words in lowercase, unless they are proper nouns.

### âœ…Â Do

- Add issue
- Create task

### ðŸš«Â Donâ€™t

- Add Issue
- Create Task

Omit unnecessary words and articles, such as ```the```, ```an,``` or ```a,``` from button labels.

### âœ…Â Do

- Add alert
- Log meeting

### ðŸš«Â Donâ€™t

- Add an alert
- Log the meeting

## Variants

| Variant Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Primary | The primary style is allocated for key call-to-action functions and should be used only once per content area or panel, such as for actions like ```Save```. |
| Secondary | Secondary buttons when no action holds greater importance than the others. Additionally, secondary buttons can serve as complements to primary actions from primary buttons, or for secondary actions. |
| Tertiary | Use tertiary buttons for subtle actions, preventing users from being diverted by primary and secondary buttons while focusing on main actions. |
| Inverse | Use inverse buttons when placing a button on a colored or dark background, where the brand color might not be easily distinguishable. |
| Support | Use support buttons to provide additional context for the intended user action. For instance, employ danger buttons to signify challenging and irreversible actions. |
