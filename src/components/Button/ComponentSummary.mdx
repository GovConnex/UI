The Button is a fundamental user interface element used to trigger actions or perform tasks in software applications and websites. It typically appears as a clickable area with text or an icon, inviting users to interact. Buttons are designed to be visually distinct, often using color, size, and style to indicate their purpose and importance. They play a crucial role in user experience, enabling intuitive navigation, form submission, or executing specific operations. Buttons enhance usability, guide users through interfaces, and contribute to a seamless and efficient interaction between users and digital platforms.
