A datepicker is a graphical user interface (GUI) element that allows users to easily select a date from a calendar. It is commonly used in web forms and applications to streamline the process of entering dates. A typical datepicker consists of an input field, where users can manually enter a date, and a graphical calendar interface that pops up when users interact with the input field.
